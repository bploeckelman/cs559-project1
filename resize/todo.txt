TODO:
--------------------------------
[ ] - Add support for different edge handling methods in resampleBilinear() (renormalize, clamp, reflect, ...)
[ ] - Add support for more resampling kernels 
(not sure how to deal with this quite yet... maybe if we resample per row, then per column the existing filter-helper functions could just be plugged in?)
